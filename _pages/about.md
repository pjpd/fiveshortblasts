This website is the brain-child of Paul Dunn.

I'm a mid 30s project manager, who dabbles in software. I've done a fair bit of sailing, and worked in Data Centers, Software, and Electronics Manufacturing.

Thanks to [https://www.wowthemes.net/](Sal of WowThemes) for the theme design, [https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll](Mediumish).
