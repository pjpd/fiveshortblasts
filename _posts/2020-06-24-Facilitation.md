The great challenge of facilitation is engagement.

The great enemy of engagement is fear. Specifically, fear of looking like an idiot.

Fear is the tool of Boggarts, and each person, place, and office has their own boggart. Sometimes they’re tame, mellow and quiet, lurking in the half-space between lullaby and screeching, calling you a try-hard and shooting you filthies. Sometimes they’re big and loud and shout a lot. Either way they kill creativity. You have a glimmer of an idea, but think “ugh, not worth it”.

That’s when you shout “Riddikulus”.

I hate warm-up games. They are a cringe-worthy nuisance, and they drag your soul through a special kind of hell. But once you’ve finished and pulled through, your group is bonded in crime. It’s like making friends by robbing a bank together. You’re dirty. You’re roguish. You’re on the inside track. Silly land. Anything is possible.

And in that space, Psychological safety.

That is the beauty. Them’s the buzzwords. Drag your team over the coals of embarrassment to a place where nothing could sound more stupid.

When your boggart has thrown you an imaginary banana, it’s much easier to say their API is killing you, the tech-debt is like subprime mortgages in 2007, and you want to A-B test a puppy and a kitten on the front page.

Then you can create.

Then you can collaborate.

Then you can fail boldly until you succeed.
