High Scalability is one of the best websites I have found in a very long time. It has regular posts about how high-scaled web platforms were achieved.

The structure of the internet can be somewhat opaque. The OSI Model splits networks into layers; physical cables, network, application … and most people stick to their lane. Because a lot of tech publications become industry mouthpieces, it is rare to see a publication be total-solution focused, rather than product or layer focused.

Enter highscalability.com. These guys are obsessed, in love, and seem to have an all-access pass to the largest corporations in the world, both in their exciting growth stages, and their behemoth optimisation stages.

Zoom, Youtube, Whatsapp, Plenty of Fish, Netflix, Flickr, Amazon. It’s all in there.

If you have more than a passing interest, dip your toes in this pond. Soon you’ll be up to a paddle, and before you know it, it’s 2am and you’ve gotten your hair wet.
