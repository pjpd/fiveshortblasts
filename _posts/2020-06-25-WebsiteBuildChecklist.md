One of the side effects of being human is suffering from the availability heuristic*, meaning you bias your thinking on what you did recently.

As a PM, most of the problems my teams encountered was with things they “just forgot” or “didn’t get to do”. Knocking out the little amateur omissions is what I consider the definition of professionalism.

And so, I checklist. Almost everything.

Here’s a short, high-level list I use for overall planning of a website.

```
- Users
- UX & Storying
- UI Asset Lead Time

- Accessibility
- Mobile compatibility
- Hit-box size
- Text Wrap on font sizes
- List order

- Architecture
- Documentation

- Deployment
- Environments
- Roadmap

- Testability
- Platforms compatibility
- Platform age / reliability

- Feature Testing
- Functional Testing
- Load
- User acceptance

- Monitoring
- Alerts
- Logging

- Failover
- Backups

- Authorisation
- Security & Pen Testing
- Production Access Control

- Licenses
- Privacy and Terms of Use
- Business Agreements
```

*If you’ve never read “[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html](Thinking Fast and Slow)“, I strongly recommend it.
